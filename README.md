# StoryTime

## Description
Our web application is a fun tool for parents and children to turn reading time into personalized experience.  Parents create a secure account, add their children and even some personal facts about them. Next they choose an age range and story style and our application magically integrates the child into each story. The application also allows for the stories to be sent to an email of the users choice.

The application utilizes MySQL/Sequelize to save user information specific to each account. Express is used to create the server. Bcrypt is incorporated to hash the password and nodemailer is used to send emails containing the generated story.
